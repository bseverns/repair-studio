# Retro Logs

Every session deserves a quick look back. Store the completed retro notes in
this directory so we can see how the system evolves over time.

## How to record a retro

1. Copy `templates/retro-template.md` into this folder and rename it
   `YYYY-MM-DD-retro.md`.
2. Capture the conversation immediately after the session wraps while
   memories are fresh.
3. Reference the latest session notes and metrics entry when you fill in
   conditions and evidence.

## Tips

- Keep the blame on the system, never the humans holding the tools.
- The "evidence" section should point to data we already collect—no mystery
  spreadsheets.
- Close the loop by tagging the owner in whatever task tracker you use.
