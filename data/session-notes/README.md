# Session Notes Archive

We park every repair session's scribe notes here so future crews can replay what happened without rummaging through group chats.

## How to capture a session
1. Copy `templates/scribe-notes.md` into this folder and rename it `YYYY-MM-DD-session-notes.md`.
2. Fill it out live while the work happens.
3. Commit or upload the notes within 24 hours so metrics and retros stay grounded in reality.

## Pointers
- Keep the tone factual and generous; blame the system, not humans.
- Link any demos or documentation updates so folks can find them later.
- Flag risks even if they feel small—they feed the retro and the metrics dashboard.
