# RISK GATES & SAFETY DEFAULTS

- **PPE & ESD** are stocked: glove wall, mats, straps. Gear up before you touch the work.
- **Risk Gates** happen before every job:
  - **GREEN** — reversible, doc-only, low voltage → Go
  - **YELLOW** — mains-adjacent / structural / solder near irreplaceables → Safety Lead present
  - **RED** — energized mains, life-safety, unknown chem/bio → Stop & escalate
- **Lockout/Tagout** mains and dangerous machinery before opening the chassis.
- **No solo high-risk work.** Pair up or escalate.
- First-aid kit, spill kit, and extinguisher live on the north wall. Say it out loud during your huddle.
- Emergencies: call local services first; then alert the hosts/on-call crew below.
