# CONSENT & DATA

- Recording/photography is **opt-in per artifact/person**. No silent capture.
- **Delete Now** requests are honored immediately—no justification needed.
- Redact sensitive identifiers before anything leaves the room.
- Capture each consent status on the intake ticket so we can prove it later.
- We follow the published Privacy & Ethics commitments: minimal data, explicit
  opt-ins, Delete-Now on demand.
