# REPAIR STUDIO

Calm fixes. Clear docs. Safer rigs.
**Opt‑in photos. Delete‑Now respected. Consent logged on ticket.**

- Pair work; no solo high‑risk tasks
- WIP cap: 1 ticket/pair, 4 active tickets room-wide unless safety_steward approves overflow
- Tag the intake ticket with lab_risk_flags & PPE before tools go live

**Demos in 60s at close — boring wins get applause. Docs or it didn't happen.**
