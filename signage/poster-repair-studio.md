# REPAIR STUDIO

Calm fixes. Clear docs. Safer rigs.

**Opt-in photos. Delete-Now respected. Privacy & Ethics commitments stay
front-and-center.**

- Pair work; no solo high-risk tasks.
- WIP limit: 1 ticket/pair, 5 in room.
- Time-boxes keep us focused.
- PPE, ESD, and lockout/tagout live on the north wall — gear up before you
  wrench.
- Intake tickets capture consent and scope; we do not skip the form.

**Demos in 60s at close — boring wins get applause.
Docs or it didn't happen.**
