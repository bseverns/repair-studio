## Steps

1. Inventory each PPE cache (respirators, gloves, aprons, goggles, ESD straps)
   against the risk-gate matrix; list missing sizes or expired filters.
2. Run two rapid fit checks with the facilitators you interviewed: respirator
   seal and ESD strap continuity; capture results and retraining needs.
3. Restock or swap gear, label bins with size ranges + expiry dates, and update
   the consumables order queue.
4. Post the refreshed PPE map next to the risk gate signage; shout out the
   changes during closing circle.
