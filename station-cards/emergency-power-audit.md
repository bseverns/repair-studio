title: "Emergency Power & Lockout Drill"
goal: "Prove every e-stop, breaker map, and lockout tag is ready for game time"
timebox: "35–50 min"
risk: "med"
done_definition:
  - "Each bay lead can kill power and recover in under 2 minutes"

## Steps

1. Walk the space with the facilitators you just interviewed; flag every tool
   that lacks a visible e-stop, disconnect, or breaker label.
2. Trip-test one green/yellow gate per zone: announce, cut power, time the
   restart, and log any sticky resets.
3. Inspect the lockout/tagout kit: confirm spare tags, documented procedure,
   and post the refreshed breaker map.
4. Close with a 60-second playback: who to call, where the PPE lives, how to
   escalate red-gate work.

## Evidence

- Photos of each e-stop, breaker panel, and posted map before/after tweaks
- Stopwatch timings + restart notes dropped into the incident/near-miss log
- Link to the updated lockout/tagout doc or safety policy snippet
