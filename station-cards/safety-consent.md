## Steps

1) Verify opt-in capture; test **Delete Now** path exactly as in the consent policy.
2) Post hotline/contact and policy signage with the current on-call names:
   - Safety Lead: Mara Ibarra — Signal/SMS +1-555-0139
   - Consent/Data Steward: Devon Ortiz — Signal/SMS +1-555-0140
   - Maintainer pod email: safety@repair.studio
   - Slack escalation (hosts only): #repair-studio-escalations
3) Run a 2-minute safety drill (locate PPE, first-aid, spill kit, extinguisher) and
   rehearse who calls emergency services vs. who pings the on-call crew.
