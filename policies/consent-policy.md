# Consent & Data Policy

- Recording/photography is **opt‑in per artifact/person**. No silent capture.
- **Delete Now**: any participant may request immediate deletion of their
  data/images without justification.
- Sensitive identifiers are redacted by default in public docs.
- Consent status is recorded on the Intake Ticket.

Questions or edge cases? Ping **Devon Ortiz (Signal/SMS +1-555-0140)** or email
[safety@repair.studio](mailto:safety@repair.studio) so the maintainer pod can
back you up.

These rules mirror the public Privacy & Ethics commitments:

- Collect the minimum data needed to run the session and fix the artifact.
- Never capture audio, video, or metadata without explicit, documented opt-in.
- Honor "Delete Now" with zero debate and confirm once purge is complete.
- Escalate questionable requests to the Data Steward or maintainer pod before
  acting.

This policy applies to classes, labs, rehearsals, and community sessions.
