# Scope of Practice

We prioritize repairs that improve safety, reduce friction, and increase
equity.

**In-scope:** documentation, labeling, strain relief, low-voltage electronics,
repo hygiene, UX papercuts, onboarding/process docs.

**Out-of-scope (without qualified lead):** energized mains work, structural
modifications, hazardous chemicals/biologicals, life-safety systems.

Publish what you *won't* do to keep everyone safe.
