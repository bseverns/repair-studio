# Privacy & Ethics (Short)

We respect people over products. When in doubt, ask and get explicit consent.

- No surveillance; detection-only if possible, with consent gates.
- Minimal data collection; store locally; set short retention.
- Clear signage; public contacts for concerns; accessible policy language.

Aligns with the Consent & Data Policy.
