# Triage Scoring Rubric (0–12)

- **Safety Risk Reduction (0–4):** does this work lower immediate lab hazard, satisfy a risk_gate, or clear PPE blockers?
- **Consent Readiness (0–2):** are consent_to_modify, consent_notes, and consent_data_scope complete and signed off by the safety_steward?
- **Impact & Resilience (0–2):** how much value or downtime prevention for the lab/community?
- **Effort/Time (0–2):** ≤30m =2, ≤90m =1, >90m =0; factor in setup/teardown from the post_work_checklist.
- **Flow Unblock (0–1):** are dependencies_waiting stalled until this lands?
- **Learning Broadcast (0–1):** 0 = no share-out, 0.5 = internal huddle, 1 = makes it into the demo/docs.

Score highest to lowest **unless** the safety_steward flags a red gate or missing consent — those become automatic stop-and-escalate.
