# Code of Conduct

We commit to a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment. Be kind. Assume
good faith. No harassment or discrimination.

- Honor pronouns and names.
- No demeaning language or exclusionary jokes.
- Observe consent-forward policies
  (see `/policies/consent-policy.md`).

**Reporting:** Use these private channels, monitored by the maintainer pod and
on-call safety crew:

- Email: [safety@repair.studio](mailto:safety@repair.studio)
- Signal/SMS hotline: **+1-555-0139** (routes to the Safety Lead on-call)
- Slack (hosts/facilitators): **#repair-studio-escalations**

Include context and links. Reports are handled promptly and confidentially.
We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and give status updates until the issue
is resolved or mitigated.

We practice the same Privacy & Ethics commitments published for the studio:

- Minimal data capture.
- Explicit consent checkpoints.
- Immediate "Delete Now" fulfillment when requested.

Consequences range from a nudge to removal from the space or repository.
