# Security & Safety Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability (digital or physical) or a serious safety concern:

- **Do not** post publicly. Email the maintainers (replace with your contact) or open a `security` issue with minimal details.
- If the issue involves **imminent safety risk**, stop work and escalate to a Safety Lead or facility owner immediately.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and resolve high-severity issues within 14 days.
