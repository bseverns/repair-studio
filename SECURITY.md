# Security & Safety Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability (digital or physical) or a serious safety
concern:

- **Do not** post publicly.
- Email [safety@repair.studio](mailto:safety@repair.studio) (maintainer pod) or
  send a Signal/SMS to the hotline at **+1-555-0139** (Safety Lead on-call).
- Hosts/facilitators can additionally ping **#repair-studio-escalations** on
  Slack to loop in the on-call crew.
- If the issue involves **imminent safety risk**, stop work, evacuate or
  secure the area as needed, call local emergency services, **then** notify the
  contacts above.

We acknowledge reports within 48 hours and resolve or provide mitigation plans
for high-severity issues within 14 days whenever feasible. We'll keep you posted
throughout triage and remediation.

If a report involves personal data, default to the Privacy & Ethics
commitments—capture only what is needed, respect Delete-Now requests, and
loop in the Data Steward before sharing information further.
