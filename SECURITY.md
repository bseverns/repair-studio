# Security & Safety Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability (digital or physical) or a serious safety
concern:

- **Do not** post publicly.
- Email **safety@repair.studio** (maintainer pod) or send a Signal/SMS to
  **+1-555-0139** (Safety Lead on-call).
- Hosts/facilitators can additionally ping **#repair-studio-escalations** on Slack
  to loop in the on-call crew.
- If the issue involves **imminent safety risk**, stop work, evacuate or secure
  the area as needed, call local emergency services, **then** notify the contacts
  above.

We acknowledge reports within 48 hours and resolve or provide mitigation plans
for high-severity issues within 14 days whenever feasible. We'll keep you posted
throughout triage and remediation.
