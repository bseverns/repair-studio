# Korg Volca Modular

Compact west-coast voice that travels between the office and home studio. Use this doc to capture tuning quirks and go-to patches.

## Why we drag it along
- Semi-modular design with analog VCOs, LPGs, and function generators in a backpack-friendly footprint.
- Syncs via 3.5 mm clock so it’ll follow the SQ64, Drumkid, or Electribe without drama.
- Excellent modulation playground for teaching modular concepts to visitors without unleashing the full AE rack.

## Power + prep
- 6× AA batteries or 9 V center-positive PSU (≥300 mA). Keep rechargeable packs in the instrument drawer.
- Mini patch cables live in the zip bag. Replace frayed cables immediately.
- Global settings (tempo sync, scale) are hidden behind `FUNCTION` combos. Log current values below so we don’t guess.

## Patch starters
- **Ambient pad**: Source → LPG → Space Out. Mod 1 to LPG, Mod 2 to Source Shape. Add slow LFO from Kastle or SQ64 for movement.
- **Perc loops**: Clock from Drumkid, route Envelope to LPG Mod, set `Divide` to `/2` for halftime sync.
- **FM clang**: Source modded by Function generator; patch Utility sum into Fold. Document the sweet spots in the notes table.

## Notes log
| Parameter | Current value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scale | 12-TET | _Change if you’re chasing microtonal madness._ |
| Clock mode | Auto |  |
| Favorite fold setting | 2 o’clock |  |

## Maintenance + mods
- Firmware is minimal; check <https://www.korg.com/us/support/download/product/0/774/> for updates.
- Keep spare battery door and knobs in `assets/hardware/volca/`.
- Clean the touch keyboard with a soft cloth only. No solvents.
