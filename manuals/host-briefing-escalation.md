# Host Briefing — Unified Escalation Flow

Use this 5-minute huddle before each session so the on-call contacts, signage,
and policies stay in sync.

## 1. Publish/Print

- Print the latest versions of:
  - `/policies/consent-policy.md`
  - `/policies/safety-policy.md`
  - `/policies/scope-of-practice.md`
  - `/signage/signage-consent.md`
  - `/signage/signage-risk-gates.md`
  - `/signage/poster-repair-studio.md`
- Post the consent sign at intake, the risk-gate sheet at the lab entrance, and
the studio poster near the main workbench.
- Confirm dates and on-call names are sharpied in if the roster rotated.

## 2. Contact Roll-call

- Safety Lead on-call: **Mara Ibarra — Signal/SMS +1-555-0139**
- Consent/Data Steward: **Devon Ortiz — Signal/SMS +1-555-0140**
- Maintainer pod email: [safety@repair.studio](mailto:safety@repair.studio)
- Slack escalation (hosts only): **#repair-studio-escalations**
- Privacy & Ethics checkpoints: minimal data capture, explicit opt-ins,
  Delete-Now on demand.

Have the crew practice sending a sample Signal message so the number is unlocked
on their phones.

## 3. Escalation Drill

Walk through a recent incident (real or hypothetical):

1. Stabilize the scene and call emergency services if needed.
2. Ping the on-call contacts above.
3. Capture facts in the incident log and coordinate follow-up.

## 4. Document the Briefing

Snap photos of the posted signage and log the huddle in the shift notes so we
have an audit trail.
