# Repair Studio — Field Card (1-page)

**Stance:** Repair is production. Calm fixes deserve applause. Buffers on
purpose. Consent-forward. Blameless + accountable.

## Roles (rotate)

- **Host/Steward** — opens/closes; protects WIP limits; runs escalation huddles
- **Triage Lead** — prioritizes; defines acceptance
- **Safety Lead** — PPE/ESD; risk gates; lockout/tagout
- **Fixer Pair** — executes; no solo high-risk
- **Scribe** — photos; docs; changelog; links
- **Demo Curator** — 60s boring-wins roundup

## Flow

Intake → Triage → Prep → Fix (paired) → Test → Document → Demo → Retro (ship
one system change)

## WIP limits & stop-loss

- Max **1** active ticket per pair; **5** per room
- Time-box expires → downshift to doc-only PR (win anyway)
- Two near-misses/week → freeze new work; run retro

## Risk gates

**Green:** reversible, doc-only, low voltage → Go

**Yellow:** mains-adjacent/structural/solder near irreplaceables → Safety Lead
present

**Red:** energized mains, life-safety, unknown chem/bio → Stop & escalate

## Unified escalation flow (hosts brief every shift)

1. Stabilize the scene. If there's imminent danger, call local emergency services first.
2. Notify the on-call crew:
   - Safety Lead: Mara Ibarra — Signal/SMS +1-555-0139
   - Consent/Data Steward: Devon Ortiz — Signal/SMS +1-555-0140
   - Maintainer pod email: safety@repair.studio
   - Slack escalation (hosts): #repair-studio-escalations
3. Capture what happened (time, people, actions) in the incident log.
4. Confirm follow-up plan with the reporter before closing the loop.

## Metrics (kind + visible)

Throughput • MTTR trend • Papercuts removed • Buffer health • Near-misses
addressed

## Consent defaults

Opt-in capture per artifact/person; **Delete Now** works in practice.
